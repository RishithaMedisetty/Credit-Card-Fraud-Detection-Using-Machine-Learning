# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
📄 Project Description

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. It utilizes anomaly detection methods like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF), along with a powerful supervised classifier, XGBoost. An interactive Streamlit app is also developed for real-time fraud prediction.

🧠 Key Features

Exploratory data analysis and visualization
Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest & LOF
Class balancing using undersampling
Supervised model training with XGBoost
Model evaluation using confusion matrix and ROC curve
Streamlit web app for real-time prediction
